You will write a tax app that calculates Ontario and Federal Tax. Please start with <a href="https://github.com/rhildred/PROG8110FinalStartingPlace" target="_blank">this github.</a>

You will need to use these rules to calculate the tax:

![Ontario Tax](https://rhildred.github.io/PROG8110Summer2018/July20FinalPractice/READMEImages/OntarioTaxReturn.png "Ontario Tax")

![Federal Tax](https://rhildred.github.io/PROG8110Summer2018/July20FinalPractice/READMEImages/Schedule1.png "Federal Tax")
