You will write a tax app that calculates Quebec Tax. Please start with <a href="https://github.com/rhildred/PROG8110FinalStartingPlace" target="_blank">this github.</a>

You will need to use these rules to calculate the tax:

![Quebec Tax](https://rhildred.github.io/PROG8110FinalStartingPlace/READMEImages/QuebecTaxForm.png "Quebec Tax")


The user interface for calculating tax requires these elements:

![User Interface](https://rhildred.github.io/PROG8110FinalStartingPlace/READMEImages/TaxCalculator.png "User Interface")

The Quebec tax project is due as a zip of your project in the assignments folder by midnight on Tuesday. A 0 mark will be awarded if your project is more than 90% similar to someone else's so work on this on your own. Your mark on this will be used instead of your midterm mark.
